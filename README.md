#cfn-response-promise module

Promise wrapped version of cfn-response.

## Why

to support the async await pattern that nodejs8.10 runtime provides.

The response.send method returns promise, so now you can write:

```
const response = require('cfn-response-promise')

exports.main = async (event, content) => {

    return await response.send(event, context, response.SUCCESS, returnData);

}
```

## Original cfn-response text

This module contains functions that respond on behalf of custom resources you create using AWS CloudFormation.

The module includes a send method, which sends a response object to a custom resource by way of a ResponseURL, which is an Amazon S3 pre-signed URL.

Any Lambda function using this module stops running after executing the module's send method.
